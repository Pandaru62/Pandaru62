You'll find all my **work**, some **external links** and **projects** I'm working on. *Enjoy your visit!*


## Where to start?

>1Ô∏è‚É£ **Teachermarks** is my key and favorite project since it's designed by a former teacher for teachers! Its very first version was a simple Excel file, then it evolved into a real web (mobile-friendly app) made with Symfony. It's currently being made on [React](https://github.com/Pandaru62/teachermarks-v2)/[NestJS]() and should be adapted into a real mobile app!

>2Ô∏è‚É£ [Prospeo]() is the first real team-work project I contributed to, with three other developers.

>3Ô∏è‚É£ [Arcadia](https://github.com/Pandaru62/studi-arcadia) is a **PHP**-based web app for a fictional **zoo** and made for academic purposes. It's the first project I've started from scratch and actually finished.
